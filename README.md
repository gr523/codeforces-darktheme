# Easy submission
- When in a problem page,pressing 's' on the keyboard will take you to the submit page
- The problem number will be automatically selected based on the previous problem page you visited
- For problems accessed from contest page,contents of the clipboard will be automatically pasted in the textarea for source code
- Pressing 's' on the submit page will trigger a click on the submit button.
- From a problem page pressing s will take you to submit page,pressing s or any key will focus on that page then pressing s will submit
- So pressing 's' 3 times will submit what you have in the clipboard at that moment
- The submit button dont has to be 's', it can be changed by using the variable `submitKey`

# Extra
- Font is bigger on the problem page so its easier to read
- Font size can be adjusted using the `problemPageFontSize` variable
- Codeforces darktheme is enabled by default,but it can be easily turned off by removing this line from the script
